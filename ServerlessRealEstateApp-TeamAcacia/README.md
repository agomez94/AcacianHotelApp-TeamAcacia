# Everett Enterprises - Acacian Hotel App Project

## Project Introduction
Everett Enterprises, a distinguished travel agency, is embarking on a new venture to create an innovative website that allows users to search for hotels based on filters such as prices, reviews, and other criteria. To accomplish this, they have decided to adopt a serverless architecture, leveraging AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway, and more AWS services for efficient content delivery. In addition, they aim to implement various DevOps tools to streamline their development process.

By embracing serverless architecture, Everett Enterprises can dynamically scale their website to handle varying traffic loads without the need to provision or manage traditional servers. AWS Lambda functions allow for the execution of backend logic in response to user requests, enabling real-time data retrieval and personalized search results.

To ensure optimal performance and responsiveness, Everett Enterprises will utilize API Gateway, which acts as a gateway for managing and securing their APIs. It allows for seamless integration with various data sources and enables efficient data retrieval, ensuring a fast and reliable hotel search experience for users.

In order to streamline their development process, Everett Enterprises plans to incorporate a range of DevOps tools. They will leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using tools such as Terraform to define and manage their AWS resources, allowing for automated and consistent infrastructure provisioning. Additionally, they will utilize Jenkins, a popular CI/CD tool, to automate the building, testing, and deployment of their website, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.

Everett Enterprises plans to utilize Docker, a popular containerization platform. Docker enables them to package their application and its dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistency across different environments. This approach simplifies deployment and promotes scalability, allowing the website to handle increasing traffic effectively.

By embracing a serverless architecture and leveraging AWS Lambda, API Gateway, combined with the efficient utilization of DevOps tools like Terraform and Jenkins, Everett Enterprises can create a robust and user-friendly website for hotel searches. This strategic approach allows them to provide an exceptional user experience, offering travelers an easy and efficient way to find the perfect accommodations for their journeys.

## Preparation
1. **AWS Architecture:** Leverage using serverless architecture as the company would perfer them not to worry about the provisioning of the services underlying infrastructure. Itiate a new design if preferred. The architecture will incorporate more then 2 DevOps tools.
2. **Infrastructure as Code:** Instead of manually creating resources through the AWS Console, we will implement Terraform to provision the companies cloud infrastructure and services.
3. **Containerization:** Docker will be used for packaging their application and its dependencies into portable containers
4. **CI/CD Pipelines:** Set up Jenkins pipelines to manage updates in real-time, allowing for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
5. **Monitoring:** Set up Prometheus to monitor their infrastructure and application performance.
6. **Visual Architecture:** Provide the customer a visual representation of the architecture using draw.io or Lucid Chart to depict the various components and their interactions.
7. **Jira Dashboard and Roadmap:** Illustrate the team's tasks, organization, and progress through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using a Jira Dashboard and Roadmap.

## Don't Forget!
- Utilize AWS Whitepapers and DevOps documentation (modules) to find useful guides and information.
- Ensure the implemented architecture is fast, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.
- Regularly update the Jira Dashboard to reflect the project's progress and current state accurately.

## Conclusion
This project is an essential milestone for Everett Enterprises as they transition to a cloud-based infrastructure. Your role in ensuring a successful migration using the best practices of DevOps and AWS technologies is crucial. Let's build a future-proof infrastructure that will drive Everett Enterprises' success in the cloud era.
