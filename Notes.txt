Project 3 notes: 

Jenkins enabled the team to automate our build, test, and deployment workflows, 
ensuring that our applications were consistently and reliably delivered.
Our Jenkins pipeline takes updates from our Git repository and 
builds or updates the Docker Container hosting our website and it's dependencies.
